# Monty Interpreter

Welcome to the Monty Interpreter project! This repository contains the source code for a simple interpreter for the Monty programming language, written in C.

## Description

Monty is an esoteric programming language designed for stack-based operations. The Monty Interpreter in this repository allows you to execute Monty programs by parsing and executing Monty bytecode files.

The interpreter reads Monty bytecode line by line and performs stack operations according to the instructions. It uses a stack data structure to push and pop values, making it suitable for implementing various algorithms and calculations.

## Features

- Interpret and execute Monty bytecode files.
- Support for a variety of stack operations, such as `push`, `pop`, `swap`, `add`, `sub`, `mul`, and more.
- Error handling for various situations, including syntax errors and runtime errors.
- Customizable error messages and handling.
- Easily extensible for adding new Monty instructions.
- Written in C for efficiency and portability.

Happy coding and stack manipulating with Monty!
